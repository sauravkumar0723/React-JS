What is a Component?
- In React, a component is a small, reusable part of the UI (User Interface).
- Think of a component as a building block of your app.
Example:
If your project is a car, its components would be:
Tyres
Engine
Doors
Gearbox

Similarly, in a React project:
The header, button, footer, or form field can be components.

Nested Components
-- A component can contain other smaller components inside it.

-- For example: A Form component may include an Input component and a Button component

Role of Components in React
-- Every part of the UI in React is made using components.
-- Components can be reused throughout the app.
-- They make the code modular, readable, and easy to maintain.

Rules for Writing Components
- Always start component names with a Capital Letter.
- Components must return a single parent tag.
- Use <div>...</div> or <>...</> (React Fragment).

You can use a component like an HTML tag:
<Fruit />
<Color></Color>

How to Write Your First React Component
In App.jsx:==

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>First Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
}


Add more components in the same file:

function Fruit() {
  return <h1>Apple</h1>;
}

function Color() {
  return <h1>Red Color</h1>;
}

Q. How to Use a Component
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>First Component</h1>
      <Fruit />        {/* Self-closing tag */}
      <Color></Color>  {/* Normal tag */}
    </div>
  );
}
Note
A React component must return a single tag.
You cannot return two or more HTML elements side by side without wrapping them.
