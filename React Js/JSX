# What is JSX?
It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript files.

Why use JSX?
JSX makes it easier and cleaner to create React elements and build the UI.

Without JSX: HTML and JavaScript are written separately.
With JSX: You can write both together in the same file.


Example with JSX:
function App() {
  const userName = "Anil Sidhu";
  let x = 20;
  let y = 30;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userName}</h1>
      <h1>{10 + 20 + 30}</h1>
      <h1>{x * y}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => alert("Hello")}>Click</button>
    </div>
  );
}


Here:

{userName} is JavaScript inside JSX.
{10 + 20 + 30} and {x * y} are also JS expressions.
The onClick event is handled using an arrow function.
